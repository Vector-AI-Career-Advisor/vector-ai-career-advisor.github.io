    <h2>The Problem: Tracking the Evolving High-Tech Jobs Market</h2>
    <div class="card">
        <p>
            Artificial intelligence systems, particularly large language models (LLMs),
            struggle to remain accurate in fast-changing domains. Since they are trained
            on static datasets, their knowledge quickly becomes outdated after deployment.
        </p>
        <p>
            This challenge is especially severe in the high-tech job market, where
            frameworks, tools, and methodologies evolve rapidly. As a result, career
            advice generated by LLMs may be inaccurate or misleading.
        </p>
        <p>
            Students and career-switchers are particularly vulnerable, as they often rely
            on AI tools due to limited access to expert human guidance.

    <div class="card">
