{
  "role": "ONE OF: Software Development|Frontend|Backend|Fullstack|AI / ML|Data Scientist|Data Engineer|Data Analyst|BI|DevOps / Cloud|Mobile|QA / Automation|Security|Embedded / Firmware|Database|Network|System Engineer|Product Manager|Team Lead|R&D|Solutions Architect",
  "seniority": "ONE OF: Intern|Junior|Mid|Senior|Lead|Staff|Principal|Manager|Director|VP|Not specified",
  "description": "4-5 sentences about daily work, systems, team context, impact",
  "experience": <integer years or null>,
  "skills_must": ["all required technologies, tools, frameworks, languages, platforms, databases, cloud services, and methodologies that are NOT marked as Advantage/Preferred/Bonus/Nice to have"],
  "skills_nice": ["only skills explicitly marked as Advantage/Preferred/Bonus/Nice to have"],
  "past_experience": ["development domains, job titles, or industry verticals that the post explicitly requires experience in — e.g. 'Backend development', 'Frontend development', 'Mobile development', 'Fullstack Developer', 'FinTech', 'SaaS', 'embedded systems'. Extract the domain/title from phrases like '3-5 years of experience in X', '4+ years of X development', 'background in X'. Do NOT include generic phrases like 'modern technologies' or 'software development'"]

}
 
Rules:
- role: derive from job TITLE only. Map the primary technology/domain in the title to the closest role value. Use "Software Development" for generic engineer/developer titles. Only use "Other" if the title has no engineering/tech signal at all
- experience: integer years or null. For "X+ years" use X (e.g. "8+ years" -> 8). For a range "X-Y years" use the lower bound X. Never return a value lower than what is written. Search the ENTIRE post for any mention of years of experience
- seniority: derive PRIMARILY from years of experience using these rules: 0-3 years = Junior, 3-5 years = Mid, 5+ years = Senior. Override with title only for explicit leadership roles: Lead/Staff/Principal/Manager/Director/VP/Senior/Mid/Junior. If no experience is mentioned anywhere AND the title has no seniority signal, use "Not specified"
- skills_must: scan the ENTIRE job post for required skills. Include every technology, tool, language, framework, platform, database, cloud service, and methodology that a candidate MUST have. Do not limit to a specific section — many posts mix requirements throughout. Exclude only items explicitly labeled Advantage/Preferred/Bonus/Nice to have
- skills_nice: only items explicitly labeled Advantage/Preferred/Bonus/Nice to have anywhere in the post
- past_experience: extract the domain or title from ANY phrase like "X years of experience in Y", "Y years of Y development", "background in Y", "experience as a Y", or "worked as Y". Capture the Y part (e.g. "Backend development", "Mobile", "FinTech"). Also include explicit job titles (e.g. "Fullstack Developer") or industry verticals (e.g. "SaaS", "FinTech") stated as desired background. Leave [] only if the post mentions zero specific domains or titles
- Always respond in English regardless of input language
- If a field is not mentioned return null for strings/numbers or [] for arrays
- skills_must should NEVER be empty if the job description mentions any technologies — always extract them
